Text: When 97110 is reported with other manual or traction therapies on the same date of service, distinct procedural services must be supported by time-separated documentation or indicated with modifier 59. Overlapping time must not be double-counted, and the clinical narrative should explain the medical necessity of performing multiple modalities in a single encounter. Claims lacking evidence of discrete time blocks or anatomical separation are subject to bundling edits and may be denied as not separately reimbursable.

Text: For beneficiaries over sixty years of age, documentation should reflect functional goals and objective measures of improvement over the course of therapy. Unspecified diagnoses such as M25.50 may be denied absent site-specific codes, and progress notes should include measurable changes in range of motion or strength. Providers are encouraged to reference outcome tools to demonstrate patient response and to justify continued therapy beyond twelve visits when medically necessary.
