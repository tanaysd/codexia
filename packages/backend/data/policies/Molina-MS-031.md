# Molina-MS-031 — Musculoskeletal Imaging
- clause_id: Molina-MS-031 §3
- effective: 2024-02-01 →
Text: Imaging performed in POS 11 requires explicit documented rationale describing why the service could not be deferred to a hospital outpatient department. Clinical notes should link symptoms and exam findings to the chosen modality and address conservative care attempts when appropriate. Absence of this rationale may result in denial for missing documentation, particularly for routine radiographs and MRIs ordered for nonspecific pain complaints.

- effective: 2024-02-01 →
Text: For advanced imaging such as CT or MRI of the spine, Molina requires prior conservative therapy including physical therapy or medication management unless contraindicated. Documentation should summarize prior treatments, duration, and patient response. Requests lacking such history or using unspecified diagnoses like M25.50 will trigger medical necessity review and may be denied. Providers are encouraged to retain signed reports and image interpretations for audit purposes.
