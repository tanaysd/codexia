# Tufts-THER-330 — Therapy Documentation
- clause_id: Tufts-THER-330 §2
- effective: 2024-07-01 →
Text: Progress notes must include time, technique, and body region for 97110 and related therapeutic exercises. Documentation should distinguish between supervised and one-on-one services and indicate whether the patient required verbal, tactile, or manual cueing. Absence of any element may trigger denial and could lead to post-payment review of the entire episode of care.

- effective: 2024-07-01 →
Text: For combined therapy sessions involving manual therapy 97140 and exercise 97110, Tufts expects explicit goals linked to functional outcomes such as improved gait or range of motion. Notes should detail patient response to each modality and justify the need for continued skilled intervention. When goals are unmet after a reasonable course of treatment, additional visits must include a reassessment plan or risk denial for lack of progress.
