# UHC-PT-222 — Therapy Bundling

Text: Bundling edits apply to 97012 and 97110 on the same date of service unless separate anatomical sites or time blocks are documented or modifier 59 is appended appropriately. Therapy performed sequentially must list distinct start and stop times for each modality, and combined documentation should clarify clinical rationale when multiple procedures address a common diagnosis. Failure to append modifier 59 when procedures are performed independently may result in denial as services included in another procedure.

Text: Claims for physical therapy exceeding fifteen visits in a ninety-day period require evidence of functional progress using objective measurement tools such as the Oswestry Disability Index. Providers should document patient-specific goals and demonstrate improvement over baseline assessments. If progress plateaus or documentation relies solely on subjective reports, additional visits may be denied as not medically necessary, and further authorization may be required for continuation.
