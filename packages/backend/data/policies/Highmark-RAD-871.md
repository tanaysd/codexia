Text: Modifier 25 on evaluation and management services billed with a minor procedure requires a significant, separately identifiable evaluation above and beyond the preoperative work. When 99213 is reported with injection code 20550 on the same encounter, the notes must clearly indicate the distinct service to support modifier 25. Documentation should include history, examination, and medical decision-making that support a distinct service. Insufficient notes or templated statements may result in recoupment upon post-payment review.

Text: Claims for diagnostic radiology performed in the physician office must note image guidance technique and interpretation time. When multiple imaging studies are performed, the report should differentiate findings for each modality. Absent detailed documentation, services may be bundled or denied, and repeated use of unspecified diagnoses may prompt an audit for medical necessity.
