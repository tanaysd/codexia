## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Implementation Details**

### **API Client Structure**
```typescript
// src/services/trainingApi.ts
interface TrainingApiClient {
  // User Management
  getUserProfile(userId: string): Promise<UserProfile>
  getUserAchievements(userId: string): Promise<Achievement[]>
  
  // Training Sessions
  startSession(request: StartSessionRequest): Promise<StartSessionResponse>
  submitAction(request: SubmitActionRequest): Promise<SubmitActionResponse>
  getHint(request: GetHintRequest): Promise<GetHintResponse>
  
  // Analytics
  getSessionAnalytics(sessionId: string): Promise<SessionAnalyticsResponse>
  getLeaderboard(): Promise<LeaderboardResponse>
}
```

### **React State Management**
```typescript
// Consider using React Context or Zustand for:
interface TrainingState {
  currentUser: UserProfile | null
  currentSession: TrainingSession | null
  currentScenario: TrainingScenario | null
  userProgress: UserProgress
  achievements: Achievement[]
}
```
